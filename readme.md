Introduction to SQL & Relational Databases

What is SQL?
------
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language 
designed for managing and manipulating data stored in relational databases
It is used to perform various operations such as creating, modifying, and querying database tables.

importance & applications of SQL
--------------------------------
SQL is used in various applications such as:
- used in web development to interact with databases e.g facebook, instagram 
- used in data analysis to extract insights from large datasets
- used in data science to build predictive models and data visualizations
- used in business intelligence to create reports and dashboards


Types of Databases
==================== 
There are several types of databases including:
- Relational databases (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL)
  based on structured tables with well-defined relationships between them 
  it uses the SQL for querying and manipulating data

- NoSQL databases (e.g. MongoDB, Cassandra)
  stores data in a flexible formats like (key value, documents, column family and graphs)
  used to handle large amounts of unstructured data eg iot

flexibility                 Rigid schema                             Flexible schema


Introduction to RDBMS
===================== 
is a software used to manage relational databases(create , modify, delete)

Popular RDBMS options 
MySQL - open source, widely used in web development
PostgreSQL - open source, known for its reliability and scalability- advanced features 
            like window functions and common table expressions
SQL server - Microsoft's RDBMS used in enterprise solutions
Oracle - commercial RDBMS used in large-scale applications

key Feature of RDBMS
---------------------
- structured tables with relationships
- ensures ACID properties (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability)
- supports multiple users and transactions

SQL basics 
setting up the database environments
 - xampp
 - wamp
 - sql server express


understanding tables, rows and columns 
database - collection of tables
table - collection of rows and columns
row - single record in a table
column - single field in a table
